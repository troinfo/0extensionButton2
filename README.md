So my first code commit .... Yay!!
The previous one didn't work for some reason.
Anyway, this is the code for a chrome extension I created for my website https://www.myrnguniverse.com
It is a random number generator that picks number for some north east coast state of the US.
I used AI - Chatgpt 4 - to improve the code base.

I created the site for my mom and here friends to help them get number ideas as they are all into the lottery.
There is some other stuff there as well: heads or tails coin flip, dice rolls and a password gen.
You are welcome to use the code but please if you do please leave a shout out to my site https://www.myrnguniverse.com
Please let me know if you have any questions.
